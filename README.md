Coffee Clicker ☕ is a browser-based incremental game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Inspired by the famous Cookie Clicker, this game challenges users to collect coffee by clicking a cup and buying producers that automate the coffee collection process (CPS - Coffee Per Second).

The core features include:

👆 Clicking interaction to gain coffee

🏭 Dynamic rendering of producers with increasing cost and quantity

📈 Real-time UI updates showing total coffee and CPS

💾 Data persistence using localStorage to save progress

💻 Clean DOM manipulation and modular game logic

It was created during the Tej Fellowship program as a way to solidify concepts of DOM traversal, event handling, state management, and local storage.

This project not only improved my JavaScript fundamentals but also deepened my understanding of how browser games work under the hood.
